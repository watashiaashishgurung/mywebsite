Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio website.

Feel free to explore, and if something catches your interest, I'd love to hear your thoughts. My favorite project is the Skyline game, which you can check out here: Skyline Game. I've always wanted to bring this game to life through coding, and I'm thrilled that I finally made it happen.

To share this game with the world, I had to dive deep into computer science. I started from the basics—like assembling a desktop computer—and worked my way up through concepts like the OSI model and computer networking, RGB colors in k-nearest neighbour algorithms, and building machine learning models decision trees, random forrests, XGBoost models with frameworks like PACE, among many other things.

My ultimate goal is to tackle poverty. Poverty is the root of many imaginations, both good and bad. With the right education and guidance, we can all unlock our intellectual potential. 
We can all be intelectually gifted.

Now I the example shown I generated the players and their guessed amount automatically. IRL You can play the game with real people and iterate every month untill everybody is satisfied.

Promise me to use this knowledge with utmost care and solidarity. Live the life you always desired because you deserve it!

Thank you for visiting and see you around.

Feel free to build you one game. You could implement insurance policies or set a time restriction and so on.
ATM I am a bit busy with some other very important stuff. DM me if you need me.

Peace and Love!
