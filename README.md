# Skyline: A Game-Based Economic Equalizer

## Overview

**Skyline** is a strategic game simulation aimed at addressing economic disparity by modeling a system in which individual talent and collective effort are key to success. Players engage in a competitive environment where calculated decision-making and fair distribution of resources determine the winners.

The game's algorithm serves as an "equalizer" where every player has a chance to win by making strategic guesses. It provides insights into how individual actions impact collective outcomes, making it a model for exploring economic behavior and systems.

## Purpose

Skyline is not just a game‚Äîit demonstrates principles that can be applied to understanding economic systems, particularly in how resources are allocated and how individuals and groups make decisions. The game aims to show that with the right balance of effort and talent, everyone can succeed, echoing the importance of fairness and equity in economic systems.

## Game Mechanics

- **Player Guessing System**: Players make guesses on an amount between a given range.
- **Winning Rounds**: Each round has one winner, determined by who makes the most accurate guess relative to the predetermined default amount.
- **Game Balance**: Each player can only win a single round, ensuring fair distribution of wins across participants.
- **Pot Distribution**: The resources are distributed based on the collective guesses and contributions of all players.
- **End Condition**: The game ends when all players have won one round.

## Features

- **Fair Chance for All**: Every player is guaranteed the opportunity to win at least one round.
- **Equalizer Concept**: Balances individual talent and collective effort, aligning with principles of equity.
- **Strategic Guessing**: Players must balance risk and reward by making calculated guesses.
- **Simulation of Economic Principles**: The algorithm reflects ideas of resource allocation and decision-making seen in real-world economic systems.

## Instructions to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have an active internet connection for external dependencies (like PyScript).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Enter the names of the players (comma-separated) and click "Start Game" to begin.
5. Follow the prompts to see the game progress and results.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game's appearance.
- **PyScript**: For running Python logic directly in the browser to handle game logic and algorithm.
- **JavaScript**: For form validation and interactive elements.

## Game Algorithm

The core of Skyline revolves around an algorithm that distributes a pot of resources (default amount) based on players' guesses. Players must guess an amount each round, with the lowest guess determining the round winner. The game simulates competition while ensuring that all players eventually win a round, balancing individual success with collective fairness.

### Player Classes

- **Player Class**: Represents individual players, tracking their name, rounds won, total amount won, and their guesses across rounds.
- **Game Logic**: Simulates rounds, calculates the winner, and distributes the pot accordingly.

## Future Improvements

- **Interactive Guessing**: Allow players to enter guesses rather than relying on randomness.
- **Improved User Interface**: Show round progress, player scores, and results on the web page.
- **Strategic Depth**: Implement more complex decision-making to increase the strategic aspect of the game.

Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio website.

Feel free to explore, and if something catches your interest, I'd love to hear your thoughts. My favorite project is the Skyline game, which you can check out here: Skyline Game. I've always wanted to bring this game to life through coding, and I'm thrilled that I finally made it happen.

To share this game with the world, I had to dive deep into computer science. I started from the basics‚Äîlike assembling a desktop computer‚Äîand worked my way up through concepts like the OSI model and computer networking, RGB colors in k-nearest neighbour algorithms, and building machine learning models decision trees, random forrests, XGBoost models with frameworks like PACE, among many other things.

My ultimate goal is to tackle poverty. Poverty is the root of many imaginations, both good and bad. With the right education and guidance, we can all unlock our intellectual potential. 
We can all be intelectually gifted.

Now I the example shown I generated the players and their guessed amount automatically. IRL You can play the game with real people and iterate every month untill everybody is satisfied.

Promise me to use this knowledge with utmost care and solidarity. Live the life you always desired because you deserve it!

Thank you for visiting and see you around.

Feel free to build you one game. You could implement insurance policies or set a time restriction and so on.
ATM I am a bit busy with some other very important stuff. DM me if you need me.

Peace and Love!

I‚Äôve designed an algorithm that aims to promote capitalism in its truest form‚Äîa system that thrives on people's talents. Everyone has unique abilities, and everyone should have the opportunity to use those talents to live up to their fullest potential. With this algorithm, regardless of your financial background, gender, or race, you can leverage your talent and the monetary system to achieve your goals.

First and foremost, the algorithm provides insurance and safety. It requires the ‚Äúapproval‚Äù of a group before investments are made, democratizing decision-making and raising awareness of potential consequences. This approach helps prevent rash decisions or excessive opportunism, encouraging a more thoughtful and responsible attitude toward investment.

Additionally, underprivileged people no longer need to fear those with ‚Äúhigher‚Äù social status or bureaucratic obstacles, as these can be more easily exposed and challenged within this system. When more money is involved, people are likely to act more cautiously and thoughtfully. Moreover, banks will benefit as well, as they can leverage increased transaction fees from the more frequent and diverse financial activities that this system encourages.

All you need to do is pursue your dreams with consistency. Surround yourself with like-minded people who believe in you. With your talent and a supportive team, you can accomplish anything in life. I understand how competitive the landscape can be within this individualistic, competition-driven capitalist monetary system. However, this algorithm makes the competition fairer, especially for those who are underprivileged.

Who wouldn‚Äôt want a world where everyone has the chance to reach their fullest potential? This is truly a story like the parable of talents.

Please let me know your thoughts‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to collaborate and refine this system together.
