Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio website.

Feel free to explore, and if something catches your interest, I'd love to hear your thoughts. My favorite project is the Skyline game, which you can check out here: Skyline Game. I've always wanted to bring this game to life through coding, and I'm thrilled that I finally made it happen.

To share this game with the world, I had to dive deep into computer science. I started from the basics‚Äîlike assembling a desktop computer‚Äîand worked my way up through concepts like the OSI model and computer networking, RGB colors in k-nearest neighbour algorithms, and building machine learning models decision trees, random forrests, XGBoost models with frameworks like PACE, among many other things.

My ultimate goal is to tackle poverty. Poverty is the root of many imaginations, both good and bad. With the right education and guidance, we can all unlock our intellectual potential. 
We can all be intelectually gifted.

Now I the example shown I generated the players and their guessed amount automatically. IRL You can play the game with real people and iterate every month untill everybody is satisfied.

Promise me to use this knowledge with utmost care and solidarity. Live the life you always desired because you deserve it!

Thank you for visiting and see you around.

Feel free to build you one game. You could implement insurance policies or set a time restriction and so on.
ATM I am a bit busy with some other very important stuff. DM me if you need me.

Peace and Love!

I‚Äôve designed an algorithm that aims to promote capitalism in its truest form‚Äîa system that thrives on people's talents. Everyone has unique abilities, and everyone should have the opportunity to use those talents to live up to their fullest potential. With this algorithm, regardless of your financial background, gender, or race, you can leverage your talent and the monetary system to achieve your goals.

First and foremost, the algorithm provides insurance and safety. It requires the ‚Äúapproval‚Äù of a group before investments are made, democratizing decision-making and raising awareness of potential consequences. This approach helps prevent rash decisions or excessive opportunism, encouraging a more thoughtful and responsible attitude toward investment.

Additionally, underprivileged people no longer need to fear those with ‚Äúhigher‚Äù social status or bureaucratic obstacles, as these can be more easily exposed and challenged within this system. When more money is involved, people are likely to act more cautiously and thoughtfully. Moreover, banks will benefit as well, as they can leverage increased transaction fees from the more frequent and diverse financial activities that this system encourages.

All you need to do is pursue your dreams with consistency. Surround yourself with like-minded people who believe in you. With your talent and a supportive team, you can accomplish anything in life. I understand how competitive the landscape can be within this individualistic, competition-driven capitalist monetary system. However, this algorithm makes the competition fairer, especially for those who are underprivileged.

Who wouldn‚Äôt want a world where everyone has the chance to reach their fullest potential? This is truly a story like the parable of talents.

Please let me know your thoughts‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to collaborate and refine this system together.
